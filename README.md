## Welcome to My 3D Portfolio

Hi! I'm **Harsh Jeswani**, a Full Stack Developer and Computer Science student at Chandigarh University. This is my immersive 3D portfolio built to showcase my web development skills and projects.

## About This Project

This portfolio is an interactive 3D experience where visitors can explore a virtual house, each room representing different aspects of my skills, projects, and achievements. The entire experience is built with modern web technologies to create a unique and engaging way to present my work.

## Technologies Used

- **React Three Fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **@react-three/drei** - Useful helpers for React Three Fiber
- **GSAP** - Animation library for smooth camera movements and transitions
- **GLSL** - Custom shaders for visual effects (smoke, particles, etc.)
- **Blender** - 3D modeling and design of the house
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **React** - UI framework

## Features

- 🏠 Interactive 3D house exploration
- 🎬 Smooth camera animations with GSAP
